# Week 9 Meeting

Charles, Natalie, Brian, and Liam Zoomed and talked about the project and how we want to prepare for milestone 3. We decided that we'd go on separate calls to work on our separate parts of the project.

Natalie and Charles worked on the database scripts.

Brian and Liam worked on front end stuff. Brian was trying to figure out how to get a simple game working. Liam was trying to figure out how to integrate his work and Brian's work.
