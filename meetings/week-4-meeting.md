# Week 4 Meeting

## Discussion

Liam: Project Milestone 1 is due this Friday 2020-02-07, so we need to figure out what we'll be doing.

Liam: Brehn and I are going to start making Project Milestone 1 document. It’ll be a markdown document that I will push to GitHub.

Brehn/Brian/Liam/Ted: We’ve got some ideas for a game...

* Battle game where there are two teams and each team has to defend its base
* Strategy game similar to Risk
* Casino
* Rogue-like

Brian: We should use Pygame.

Brehn/Liam/Ted: It would be nice to use Django and Pygame.

Liam: I'm also going to make the three different repositories.

Brehn/Liam/Ted: We need to zero in on what exactly we're going to do soon.
